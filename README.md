# Populating_People

This is a separate mini-project I decided to create to practice using Classes in Javascript. You should be able to populate plenty of characters within this, such as warriors, clerics, archers, etc. I guess this is the gamer in me coming through :) Hopefully it's not too lofty of a goal!
